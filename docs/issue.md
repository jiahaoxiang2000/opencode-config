# Issue

## Problem: Slow CLI Startup Due to Plugin Package Installation

Plugin package installation is very slow without a proxy, causing significantly long CLI startup times.

### Setup

Create an alias to use a proxy when starting opencode:

```bash
alias opencode-proxy='HTTPS_PROXY=http://localhost:1080 opencode'
```

### Debugging

To debug startup performance with proxy enabled, run:

```bash
HTTPS_PROXY=http://localhost:1080 opencode --log-level DEBUG --print-logs
```

Logs are located at `~/.local/share/opencode/log`.

### Alternative Mitigation: Skip Plugin Installation

If you don't need the authentication plugins (e.g., `opencode-anthropic-auth` and `opencode-copilot-auth`), you can skip their installation entirely. This avoids the slow package resolution and download phase, significantly reducing CLI startup time.

To do this, configure OpenCode to not install or use the plugins during startup.
